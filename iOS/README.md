# HMS iOS Application

# Build
To build iOS, a computer running macOS is required. After the repository is cloned, a user has to open terminal and type `pod install` within the iOS project directory. Then they need to open the `hmsensyne ios mvp.xcworkspace` file. All the remaining packages that need to be installed via Swift Package Manager should install on their own. 

The user has to plug in the iPhone, they want to deploy the application to the computer. Then select the device from the list of available devices. Using keyboard shortcut `CMD + R`, the build will start and the application will be installed on the device.
