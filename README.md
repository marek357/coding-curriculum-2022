# Coding Curriculum 2022

## Project structure

The repository consists of three folders - `Android`, `iOS` and `Backend`. Each folder is its own project and should be treated as a standalone project. They are bundled together for the convinience of having each piece of the program in the same place. 

Each directory contains a README file, which explains how to build the code.
